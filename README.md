# exercises
A repository where to share answers to the exercises and hand-on sessions for the 2020-2021 PHY651G class (["Methods of statistical analysis and simulation"](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/course/view.php?id=11113))

NB: as ([stated in Moodle](https://moodle.polytechnique.fr/mod/page/view.php?id=132496)), weekly exercises and hands-on sessions are NOT graded: they are there only to learn and train.

## How to join?
Send an email to emilien.chapon@cern.ch with your github login, asking to be added to the team.

## How to contribute?
The repository is organised into two branches: the `main` branch, with the exercises wordings, skeletons, and solutions, and the `students` branch for collaborative work between the students while they are working on the exercises.
* `git clone git@github.com:PHY651G2020/exercises.git`
* `git checkout students` 
* (work on the solution)
* `git add someFile_myname`
* `git commit someFile_myname`
* `git push origin students`

Please do not push to the `main` branch (default branch). Collaborative work between students should be kept to the  students` branch.
